=> rune
    is a data type that is a unique integer value that corresponds to a character in the Unicode standard.  used when working with individual characters within a string. is an alias for the int32 type
    
    Declare and initialize a string containing a Unicode character
    smiley := "😃"

    Converting a string to a slice of runes
    runes := []rune(smiley)

    Character-level operations
    firstRune := runes[0]
    isDigit := unicode.IsDigit(firstRune)

    Printing
    fmt.Println(smiley)     // Output: 😃
    fmt.Println(runes)      // Output: [128515]
    fmt.Println(isDigit)    // Output: false

=> go fmt
    - go fmt - primarily handles the formatting of Go source code, ensuring that it adheres to the official Go style guidelines.
    - vs code inbuilt formatter uses go fmt indirectly (using go pls) to format the code. 

=> mod history
    - https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/history-of-dependency-management-go Well explained. 
    - go get vs go install vs go mod tidy
        - go install is used to install a binary, not a package
        - go get to download a package
        - go mod tidy scans your project and updates the go.mod file and downloads all dependencies mentioned in the go.mod file
        - go mod download only downloads the dependencies from go.mod, without modifications of the go.mod file

        - executables refer specifically to Go command-line tools or binaries that are installed and can be run directly as standalone programs.
        - Now see https://go.dev/doc/go-get-install-deprecation
        - We use go get for the packages/dependency. 
        - For executables we should use go install

        - Since modules were introduced, the go get command has been used both to update dependencies in go.mod and to install commands. This combination is frequently confusing and inconvenient: in most cases, developers want to update a dependency or install a command but not both at the same time.
        - Since Go 1.16, go install can install a command at a version specified on the command line while ignoring the go.mod file in the current directory (if one exists). go install should now be used to install commands in most cases.
        - go get’s ability to build and install commands is now deprecated, since that functionality is redundant with go install. Removing this functionality will make go get faster, since it won’t compile or link packages by default. go get also won’t report an error when updating a package that can’t be built for the current platform.

=> type assertion vs type conversion
    - string(i) vs i.(string) 

    string(i)
        Type Conversion: Converts a value of a different type (e.g., int, byte, or rune) into a string.

    i.(string)
        Type Assertion: Asserts that an interface{} value (i) is of type string.
